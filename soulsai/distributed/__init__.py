"""The distributed module contains the server and client services for distributed RL.

Clients generate experience by deploying the agent in the target environment, and send samples to
the server stack. The servers then update the model and send the updated networks to the clients.

The server module also contains nodes to track the current training progress, check the health of
all nodes, display this information live in a web view, and encrypt connections to the server.
